    "A client at your analytics firm is considering opening a pizza restaurant in New York City. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have asked you to develop a business intelligence report to fact check the following claims:\n",
    "1. Your client wants to ensure they have an above average Yelp rating. They have previously owned restuarants in other cities, where a `3` was the average. They would like to know if that holds true in New York City. \n",
    "1. Your client has noticed that restaurants on yelp with a high review count seem to be quite successful. They have decided to focus on maximizing their review count which they believe will allow them to have an above average overall review. \n",
    "1. After looking at a few restaurants on Yelp, your client believes that most above average restaurants have a price point of `$$`. They are considering increasing their prices from `$` to `$$` to match the majority of above average restaurants, and would like you to find the most common price point for above average restaurants in New York City.\n",
    "1. In terms of location they have been told that above average restaurants are usually further east and below average are usually further west, but that the biggest difference is whether the restaurant is on the north or south side. They would like you to determine if the data supports this claim.\n",
    "1. They believe that the `10012` zipcode in New York City is the best place to open a restaurant. They wish to open a restaurant in close proximity to other highly rated restaurants, and they believe `10012` has the most in NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this analysis is _descriptive_, meaning your analysis should report calculated statistics such as `counts` and `mean`, and should be focused on providing a simple, factual, understanding of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
